# Word search generator

A simple application that generates a word search grid using a silly brute force algorithm
(that doesn't allow any overlapping words).

Built using Tauri + Solid + Typescript.

## Running

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

## Exporting

I just print out the page using `ctrl+p`, and manually set:

- landscape
- 49% zoom (for a 20x20 grid on A4 paper YMMV).

## License

MIT, see `LICENSE` in the repo.
